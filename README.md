# class-ab-amplifier
Class AB (headphone) amplifier for FlexRadio project.

## The circuit

This circuit is a simple Class AB amplifier for FlexRadio (or for other) project. Ther is clamp in the input stage, the optimal maximum input voltage is 50mV (R2 = 2.2k). If the R2 = 12.2k than the input voltage can be 100mV.
